# FocusBoard
A board that allows users to create and vote on features or tasks in a similar method to Canny.io

This Git contains the core system, but no repository layers, eventually a fork will exist for both a SQL version and a MongoDB version of the repository layers

The system is formed of an API only, a UI maybe created later but at this time nothing is planned...

This was designed as a coding practice excercise
